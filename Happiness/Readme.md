## Happiness Python Machine Learning Project

**

The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll.

In this project, we will examine the data and build different machine learning models that will detect the happines score based on the features given.
